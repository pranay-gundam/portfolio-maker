1. Fix errors with the domain calculation (think about a call on an up and out
   barrier option, how does domain calculation and pricing work when options
   are stacked like that?). Fix the Barrier option calculation as well.
2. Make a .exe file
3. Price other options that are included in the README file
4. Create functionality to be able to create a replicating portfolio, verify if
   a market is arbitrage free, or verify if a market is complete.
5. Get real time data from online and incorporate that into the porfolio maker
