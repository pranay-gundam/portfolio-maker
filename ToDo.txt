0. Fix errors with the domain calculation (think about a call on an up and out
   barrier option, how does domain calculation and pricing work when options
   are stacked like that?)
1. Test all the options and functions made to far using test code from 21-370
2. Create functionality to create portfolios
3. Make a .exe file and a user interface
4. Price other options that are included in the README file
5. Create functionality to be able to create a replicating portfolio, verify if
   a market is arbitrage free, or verify if a market is complete.
6. Get real time data from online and incorporate that into the porfolio maker

Portfolio Pricing:
1. Within pricing, edit it so that the dictionary key is a tuple of the number
   of ups, number of downs, and the underylying price.
2. In the portfolio pricing then use the keys of each asset (their ups and downs
   not the underlying price) to add each specific value.
